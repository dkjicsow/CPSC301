This file is designed to both drive doctest.testfile() and provide an input
file when testing dna_counter.py.

It is designed to be used with doctest.testfile(), which treats this
whole file as essentially a giant docstring.  Therefore it ignores lines
like these ones (including that DNA sequence above), and looks for lines that 
start with the Python interpreter prompt.

First we need to make sure the function is available:

>>> from improved_counter import readFasta, count_dna

Now we can run the test using this file as an input:

>>> count_dna(readFasta('counter_test_percent.txt'))
Reading sequence:  This line looks like the header of a FASTA file.
Warning: Multiple sequences encountered; only the first is returned.
